# OPTRE_Series
The OPTRE missions currently take place in the year 2517 in the middle of the UNSC's Operation: Trebuchet during the Insurrection conflict. You play as a UNSC ODST team called Phoenix and engage insurrectionists in spec-ops and frontline combat.

Currently, my OPTRE missions do not follow a story like my SABRE Series does. I plan to change that with a small military campaign on Malden (3 to 4 missions) that started with the Helljumpers mission. After that I plan to move on to other maps and unit types (e.g. the Marines and Spartans).

Trivia: The Spartan-II program began in the year 2517.

All OPTRE Missions Feature:

	SP / COOP - (Varying Amounts of Players)
	Parameters for Multiplayer 
	FHQ Tasktracker by Varanon
	AIS Revive by Psycho
	Varying amounts of randomization

Operation Trebuchet and CBA are required
